SQLAlchemy Loading Tools
========================

A collection of wrappers and functions to make SQLAlchemy core easier 
to use in an ETL application. The package is used only for database
abstraction and not as an ORM, allowing users to write extraction
scripts that can work with multiple database backends.

Functions are provided to easily select and update records in a
transformation pipeline.
